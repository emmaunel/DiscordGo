Discord C2 for Redteam engagement....Need a better name.
If you can think of one, please tell me. :)

Not to be confused with DiscordGo library which I use for the backend.

# Why I made this

During Blue-Red Team competition, I needed an easy and fast way to keep connected and a way for mutiple redteamer to run commands, hence DiscordGo.
Since Discord is getting popular, why not use the platorm as a c2.
That's what this project is about.

# Installation

To use DiscordGo, you need to create a Discord bot and a Discord server. After that, invite the bot to your server.

Click [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-) to learn how to create a server and [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) to create a bot. And finally, learn to invite the bot to your server with [this.](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links)

When creating the bot, you need it give it some permission. For testing, I gave the bot full `administrative` permission. But the required permission are as follow:

* Send Messages
* Read Messages
* Attach Files
* Manage Server

# Usage

~~Edit this file `pkg/util/variables.go` with your `BotToken` and `ServerID`. Or create the file if not there~~

GOOD NEWS, No need to edit any files. After learning some interesting build flags in go. All you have to do is run `make`. 

This will ask you for the necessary information and create the binaries off of that. Example below:

  </a>
</p>


The bot token can be found on discord developer dashboard where you created the bot. To get your server ID, go to your server setting and click on `widget`. On the right pane, you see the your ID.

After that is done, That will create 5 agent binaries and 1 organizer binary. 

```
- linux-agent
- windows-agent.exe
- macos-agent
- rasp-agent
- bsd-agent
```

## Organizer Bot

When you have target connecting back to your discord server, channels are created by their ip addresses. This can quickly get difficult to manage. Solution: Another bot to organize the targets channels.

To use the organizer bot, run the csv generator script in the scripts folder:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 csv_generator.py
```

This will create a csv like this:

```
192168185200,team01,hostname1,windows
192168185201,team02,hostname2,linux
```

To start the organizer bot: `go run cmd/organizer/main.go -f <csv_filename>.csv` or `./organizer -f <csv_filename>.csv`

Run `clean` in any channel to organize bots into their respective categories.
